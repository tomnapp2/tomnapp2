- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomnapp2
- 👀 I’m interested in signal processing for chemical sensors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Notion's API so that people can surface content from their Notion workspaces when using third party search tools (like [Fluent Search](https://github.com/adirh3/Fluent-Search))
- 💞️ Heart emoji.
- 📫 How to reach me: Please use [Naval flag signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_flag_signalling)
